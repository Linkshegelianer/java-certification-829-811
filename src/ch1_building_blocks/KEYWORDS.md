# Keywords, reserved words & literals

1. **Keywords**: Java reserves the following 50 character sequences for use as keywords and cannot be used as identifiers and labels. These words have a special meaning in the Java language, and so they cannot be used as anything else such as variable names in your code.

`abstract assert boolean break byte case catch char class const continue default do double else enum extends final finally float for goto if implements import instanceof int interface long native new package private protected public return short static strictfp super switch synchronized this throw throws transient try void volatile while  `

Important: `goto` and `const` are not used in Java, but still regarded as keywords.

2. **Reserved words**: Keywords and reserved words mean the same thing, since keywords are reserved by Java and cannot be used as identifiers and labels.

3. **Literals**: constant values that appear directly in the program and are assigned directly to a variable. `true` and `false` might appear to be keywords, but they are technically boolean literals. Similarly, while `null` might appear to be a keyword, it is technically the null literal. You cannot use literals as identifiers either.
