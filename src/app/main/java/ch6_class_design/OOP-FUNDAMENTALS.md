# OOP fundamentals (from OCFA preparation tests)

Fundamental principles of Object Oriented Programming:
- code reuse
- hiding unnecessary details
- data abstraction
- polymorphism â†’ dynamic & reusable code
- inheritance


**Encapsulation**:  
Member fields are declared private and public accessor/mutator methods are provided to access and change their values if needed.


**Inheriting fields**:
- private are never inherited
- package are inherited when classes in the same package
