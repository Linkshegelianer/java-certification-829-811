Inheriting fields:
- private are never inherited
- package are inherited when classes in the same package

Encapsulation:
Member fields are declared private and public accessor/mutator methods are provided to access and change their values if needed.

Polymorphism:
- more dynamic and reusable code

fundamental principles of Object Oriented Programming
