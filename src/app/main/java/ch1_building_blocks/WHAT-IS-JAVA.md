# What is Java

.class files are not executable, JVM is executable program
JAR - archive of Java class files

JRE interprets bytecode

JRE contains:
- Java Application Launcher
- Virtual Machine
- Java standard class library (not Java API)

In order to run bytecode on any OS and architecture, you only need JRE available for them.

Bytecode is platform independent!!

Java compiler converts the source code into binary code, which is run by an interpreter

JDK provides:
* JRE
* API for Java SE Standard
* Database engine (before JDK 11)
* Integration libraries (JDBC API)
* Networking protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS)

Java Web Start (Java WS, JAWS) framework allows users to start application from browser
